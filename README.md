## General information


[Pepper](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper) is a conversion framework for linguistic data. 
*pepperModules-FLExModules* is a plugin for *Pepper* and provides an
importer for **FLEx XML**, i.e., the XML
export format from 
[SIL Fieldworks Language Explorer](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/). 
The format
is used frequently for persisting language documentation data.

With the *pepperModules-FLExModules* importer, the data stored in FLEx XML 
interlinear text files can be transferred to another format. This way, the data 
can be re-used for other
purposes (such as adding different annotation types), or visualized and analyzed,
e.g., in [ANNIS](http://corpus-tools.org/annis), a search and visualization 
platform for linguistic data. For a list of available format converters for Pepper,
see the [list of known Pepper modules](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/knownModules.html).

## Context

The development of pepperModules-ToolboxTextModules has been initiated in the 
[MelaTAMP research project](https://hu.berlin/melatamp).

## Requirements

`Pepper >= 3.1.1-SNAPSHOT`

## Usage

- Create a [Pepper workflow 
file](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/userGuide.html#workflow_file) for the 
conversion, with the importer set to `FLExImporter`. Configure #properties as
needed.
- [Download Pepper](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/), and run it with the 
workflow file.

## Importer

### Requirements, assumptions, behaviour

#### Annotation mapping

FLEx XML has features that necessitate a certain importer behaviour with regard
to annotation namespace and names.

In *Salt*, the data model onto which data is mapped during import, annotations
can have a `namespace`, and a `name`. In *FLEx XML*, one and the same annotation
name, i.e., the `'type'` of an `<item>` can be used on different *levels*, i.e.,
`<phrase>`, `<word>` or `<morph>`, etc. Additionally, an `<item>` also has a
`'lang'`, so 3 attributes in *FLEx XML* (*level*, *'lang'*, *'item'*) must be 
mapped onto 2 attributes in *Salt* annotations.

To preserve the *level* information of annotation during conversion, the
*FLExImporter* maps it by adding the container (node/edge) of the annotation
to a layer with the name of the level, i.e., `phrase`, `word`, and `morph`.
Annotations on the document (FLEx level `interlinear-text`) are being made
on the Salt document (`SDocument`), which itself cannot be added to a layer -
the layer is a node in an `SDocument`'s graph. Instead, all annotations on the
document itself can be assumed to belong the `interlinear-text` level.

At the same time, the *'lang'* information is recorded in the namespace of the
*Salt* annotation.

Therefore, if clients such as exporters need to re-combine this information, 
they need to retrieve language information from the namespace, and type 
information from the name of the annotation, and the *level* of the annotation
from the *layer name* of the layer included in the set of layers which the 
container of the annotation is a part of, or the information whether an 
annotation is attached to an `SDocument`. The importer will create exactly one
layer for each level, which will be named `phrase`, `word`, `morph` (according 
to the XML schema XSD file supplied by SIL, paragraphs cannot have annotations).

	 *  - keys: `{interlinear-text|paragraph|phrase|word|morph}::{language}:name`
	 *  - values: `name`
	 *  - list: `key=value, ...`
	 *  
	 *  Behaviour:
	 *  
	 *  For annotations matching the key pattern, the name will
	 *  be changed to the `name` value. `language` will not be
	 *  changed, layer neither.
	 *  
	 *  Example:
	 *  
	 *  `annotationMap=word::en:gls=ge` will change the FLEx-notated
	 *  annotation `<word><item type="gls" lang="en">green</item></word>`
	 *  to an {@link SAnnotation} on an {@link SLayer} named "word"
	 *  with namespace "en" and name "ge".

## One document per file

As *FLExText* files can contain `n` documents (corresponding to the XML element `interlinear-text`).
However, files with more than one `interlinear-text` element cannot currently
be processed by the FLExImporter.

# Development workflow

The development workflow for this project uses 
[Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and the 
[JGit-Flow](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jgit-flow/) Maven plugin, which 
solves a lot of the headache provided by the
[Maven Release Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/), 
e.g., SNAPSHOTs in the `master` branch.

## Features

Features are developed as usual in feature branches and merged back onto
`develop` once they are finished.

## Releases

Releases are tagged as such on GitHub and must be released to Maven Central.
This is done by running `mvn jgitflow:release-start` and 
`mvn jgitflow:release-finish` on `development`. The JGit-Flow plugin takes
care of following the Gitflow workflow while performing a release to
Maven Central at the same time.

Note that the staged release will still have to be released manually through
<https://oss.sonatype.org/>.

Add anything that's needed to the GitHub release, update the DOI in the
README (prereserve on Zenodo), publish the GitHub release, and update the
Zenodo release.
